# Some Python Application

What can it do?

 - make calculations with user input numbers
   - but... this -> 1.2 - 1.0 = 0.199999999999999996
 - print out a file to the console
   - but do nothing with it, yet...
 - slots

This was a school project. I was supposed to make a simple slots program using the console.
I might have gone a little bit off-track...
